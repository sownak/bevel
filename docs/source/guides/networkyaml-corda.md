# Configuration file specification: R3 Corda
A `network.yaml` configuration file serves as a centralized and comprehensive blueprint, capturing the essential parameters and configurations needed to set up the entire Corda DLT network. It allows the users to define the network ports, participant nodes, notary service urls, and various parameters crucial for the network's operation. This file needs to be updated for your specific network setup before using it with the Ansible playbooks.

??? note "Schema Definition"

    A json-schema definition is provided in `platforms/network-schema.json` to assist with semantic validations and lints. You can use your favorite yaml lint plugin compatible with json-schema specification, like `redhat.vscode-yaml` for VSCode. You need to adjust the directive in template located in the first line based on your actual build directory:

    `# yaml-language-server: $schema=../platforms/network-schema.json`

The configurations are grouped in the following sections for better understanding.

* [type](#type)

* [version](#version)

* [env](#env)

* [docker](#docker)

* [network_services](#network_services)

* [organizations](#organizations)

Although, the file itself has comments for each key-value, here is a more detailed description with respective snippets.
=== "Corda Opensource"
    Use this [sample configuration file](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/main/platforms/r3-corda/configuration/samples/network-cordav2.yaml) as a base.
    ```yaml
    --8<-- "platforms/r3-corda/configuration/samples/network-cordav2.yaml:7:14"
    ```
=== "Corda Enterprise"
    Use this [sample configuration file](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/main/platforms/r3-corda-ent/configuration/samples/network-cordaent.yaml) as a base.
    ```yaml
    --8<-- "platforms/r3-corda-ent/configuration/samples/network-cordaent.yaml:7:14"
    ```
<a name="type"></a>
type
: `type` defines the platform choice like corda/fabric/quorum. Use `corda` for **Corda Opensource** and `corda-enterprise` for **Corda Enterprise**.

<a name="version"></a>
version
: `version` defines the version of platform being used, here in example the Corda version is 4.9. Please note only 4.4 above is supported for **Corda Enterprise**.

<a name="env"></a>
env
: `env` section contains the kubernetes settings like flux tag, proxy etc. as describe below.

```yaml
--8<-- "platforms/r3-corda/configuration/samples/network-cordav2.yaml:16:27"
```
The fields under `env` section are

|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| type       | Environment type. Can be like dev/test/prod.|
| proxy      | Choice of the Cluster Ingress controller. Currently supports `ambassador` only as `haproxy` has not been implemented for Corda |
| ambassadorPorts   | Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`     |
| loadBalancerSourceRanges | (Optional) Restrict inbound access to a single or list of IP adresses for the public Ambassador ports to enhance network security. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`.  |
| retry_count       | Retry count for the checks. Use a large number if your kubernetes cluster is slow. |
| external_dns       | If the cluster has the [external DNS service](../tutorials/dns-settings.md#external-dns), this has to be set `enabled` so that the hosted zone is automatically updated. |

<a name="docker"></a>
