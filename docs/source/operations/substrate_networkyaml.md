# Configuration file specification: Substrate
A network.yaml file is the base configuration file designed in Hyperledger Bevel for setting up a Substrate DLT network. This file contains all the configurations related to the network that has to be deployed. Below shows its structure.
![](./../_static/TopLevelClass-Substrate.png)

Before setting up a Substrate DLT/Blockchain network, this file needs to be updated with the required specifications.  

A sample configuration file is provided in the repo path:  
`platforms/substrate/configuration/samples/network-sample.yaml` 

A json-schema definition is provided in `platforms/network-schema.json` to assist with semantic validations and lints. You can use your favorite yaml lint plugin compatible with json-schema specification, like `redhat.vscode-yaml` for VSCode. You need to adjust the directive in template located in the first line based on your actual build directory:

`# yaml-language-server: $schema=../platforms/network-schema.json`

The configurations are grouped in the following sections for better understanding.

* type

* version

* env

* docker

* config

* organizations

Here is the snapshot from the sample configuration file

![](./../_static/NetworkYamlSubstrate.png)

The sections in the sample configuration file are  

`type` defines the platform choice like corda/fabric/indy/substrate, here in the example its **substrate**.

`version` defines the version of platform being used. The current substrate version support is for **latest**

---

`env` section contains the environment type and additional (other than 8443) Ambassador port configuration. Value for proxy field under this section can only be Ambassador as haproxy has not been implemented for substrate.

The snapshot of the `env` section with example value is below
```yaml 
  env:
    type: "substratedev"              # tag for the environment. Important to run multiple flux on single cluster
    proxy: ambassador               # value has to be 'ambassador' as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for Substrate
    #  These ports are enabled per cluster, so if you have multiple clusters you do not need so many ports
    #  This sample uses a single cluster, so we have to open 4 ports for each Node. These ports are again specified for each organization below
    ambassadorPorts:                # Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here, this is valid only if proxy='ambassador'
      portRange:              # For a range of ports 
        from: 15010 
        to: 15043
    # ports: 15020,15021      # For specific ports    
    retry_count: 20                 # Retry count for the checks on Kubernetes cluster
    external_dns: enabled           # Should be enabled if using external-dns for automatic route configuration
```
The fields under `env` section are 

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| type       | Environment type. Can be like dev/test/prod.|
| proxy      | Choice of the Cluster Ingress controller. Currently supports 'ambassador' only as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for Substrate |
| ambassadorPorts   | Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`. These ports are enabled per cluster, so if you have multiple clusters you do not need so many ports to be opened on Ambassador. Our sample uses a single cluster, so we have to open 4 ports for each Node. These ports are again specified in the `organization` section.     |
| retry_count       | Retry count for the checks. Use a high number if your cluster is slow. |
|external_dns       | If the cluster has the external DNS service, this has to be set `enabled` so that the hosted zone is automatically updated. |

`docker` section contains the credentials of the repository where all the required images are built and stored.

The snapshot of the `docker` section with example values is below
```yaml
  # Docker registry details where images are stored. This will be used to create k8s secrets
  # Please ensure all required images are built and stored in this registry. 
  # Do not check-in docker_password.
  docker:
    url: "docker.io"
    username: "docker_username"
    password: "docker_password"
  
```
The fields under `docker` section are

| Field    | Description                            |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| url      | Docker registry url                    |
| username | Username required for login to docker registry (remove this for public registry)|
| password | Password required for login to docker registry (remove this for public registry)|


`config` section contains the common configurations for the Substrate network.

The snapshot of the `config` section with example values is below
```yaml
  config:
    ## Certificate subject for the root CA of the network. 
    #  This is for development usage only where we create self-signed certificates and the truststores are generated automatically.
    #  Production systems should generate proper certificates and configure truststores accordingly.
    subject: "CN=DLT Root CA,OU=DLT,O=DLT,L=London,C=GB"
    # Provide the docker image which will be used for the Substrate Nodes in this network. (will be downloaded from docker.url)
    node_image: "inteli-poc/dscp-node"
    # Provide the command which is used to start the node
    command: "./dscp-node"     # Please ensure the command corresponds to the node_image above, for eg, target/debug/node-template    
    # provide a chain name for Substrate nodes
    chain: "inteli"
    # NOTE for the below paths, the directories should exist
    bootnodes: "/BUILD_DIR/substrate_bootnodes" # Location where bootnodes information is read or saved if empty
    genesis: "/BUILD_DIR/substrate_genesis"   # Location where information is read or saved if empty
    ipfsbootnodes: "/BUILD_DIR/ipfs_bootnodes" # Location where IPFS bootnodes information is read or saved if empty    
  
```
The fields under `config` are

| Field       | Description                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| subject     | This is the subject of the root CA which will be created for the Substrate network. The root CA is for development purposes only, production networks should already have the root certificates.   |
| node_image | This is image name in which will be pulled from the specified docker registry. |
| command | This is the command which will run on the substrate node once it is alive.|
| chain | This is the name of the chain which is used for the substrate nodes and genesis.|
| bootnodes | Location where bootnode information is read or stored if empty, this is for bootnodes specified in the organization section of the configuration file. |
| genesis | This is the path where genesis.json will be stored for a new network.|
| ipfsbootnodes | Location where IPFS bootnode information is read or stored if empty, this is for IPFS nodes when you are deploying a DSCP network. |


The `organizations` section contains the specifications of each organization.  

In the sample configuration example, we have four organization under the `organizations` section.

The snapshot of an organization field with sample values is below
```yaml
  organizations:
    # Specification for the 1st organization. Each organization should map to a VPC and a separate k8s cluster for production deployments
    - organization:
      name: oem
      type: superuser
      persona: buyer
      external_url_suffix: subs.inteli-poc.com   # This is the url suffix that will be added in DNS recordset. Must be different for different clusters
      cloud_provider: gcp   # Options: aws, azure, gcp
```
Each `organization` under the `organizations` section has the following fields. 

| Field                                    | Description                                 |
