# DSCP - Digital Supply Chain Platform

### A sample supply chain application deployed on Substrate based DLT network using Hyperledger Bevel
<br/>
This demo application has been developed to demonstrate the benefits of distributed systems to the additive-manufacturing industry within aerospace. The application defines a consortium of multiple organizations. It allows nodes to track products or goods along with their chain of custody. It provides the members of the consortium all the relevant data about their product throughout it's journey, from raw material to the finished product. It provides simple web clients that let you perform the actions of different personas in a supplychain industry.
