## CA Tools Hyperledger Fabric Deployment Helm Chart
---
A [Helm chart](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/hyperledger-fabric/charts/catools) to deploy Fabric CA tools.


<a name = "prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites
---
Before deploying the Helm chart, make sure to have the following prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- A HashiCorp Vault instance is set up and configured to use Kubernetes service account token-based authentication.
- The Vault is unsealed and initialized.
- Helm installed.


<a name = "chart-structure"></a>
## Chart Structure
---
The structure of the Helm chart is as follows:

```
catools/
  |- templates/
      |- _helpers.yaml
      |- configmap.yaml
      |- deployment.yaml
      |- volume.yaml
  |- Chart.yaml
  |- README.md
  |- values.yaml
```

- `templates/`: Contains the Kubernetes manifest templates that define the resources to be deployed.
- `helpers.tpl`: Contains custom label definitions used in other templates.
- `configmap.yaml`: Contains definitions for six different configmaps. These configmaps will be used by the main and store-vault containers through volume mounting to support their respective tasks.
- `deployment.yaml`: The init-container generates the cryptographic material for the Fabric CA server and checks if the cryptographic material already exists in Vault. If it does, the init-container will skip the generation process. The main container runs the Fabric CA server, issues certificates to clients in the organization, and has a liveness probe that checks if the Fabric CA server is running. The store-vault container stores the cryptographic material in Vault, Checks if any certificates have not been stored correctly.
- `volume.yaml`: Defines 2 persistent volume to store the data. 
- `Chart.yaml`: Contains the metadata for the Helm chart, such as the name, version, and description.
- `README.md`: Provides information and instructions about the Helm chart.
- `values.yaml`: Contains the default configuration values for the Helm chart.

## Configuration
---
The [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/hyperledger-fabric/charts/catools/values.yaml) file contains configurable values for the Helm chart. We can modify these values according to the deployment requirements. Here are some important configuration options:

<a name = "deployment"></a>
## Deployment
---

To deploy the catools Helm chart, follow these steps:

1. Modify the [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/main/platforms/hyperledger-fabric/charts/catools/values.yaml) file to set the desired configuration values.
2. Run the following Helm command to install the chart:
    ```
    $ helm repo add bevel https://hyperledger.github.io/bevel/
    $ helm install <release-name> ./catools
    ```
Replace `<release-name>` with the desired name for the release.

This will deploy the catools node to the Kubernetes cluster based on the provided configurations.


<a name = "verification"></a>
## Verification
---

To verify the deployment, we can use the following command:
```
$ kubectl get deployments -n <namespace>
```
Replace `<namespace>` with the actual namespace where the deployment was created. The command will display information about the deployment, including the number of replicas and their current status.


<a name = "updating-the-deployment"></a>
## Updating the Deployment
---

If we need to update the deployment with new configurations or changes, modify the same [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/main/platforms/hyperledger-fabric/charts/catools/values.yaml) file with the desired changes and run the following Helm command:
```
$ helm upgrade <release-name> ./catools
```
Replace `<release-name>` with the name of the release. This command will apply the changes to the deployment, ensuring the catools node is up to date.

<a name = "deletion"></a>
## Deletion
---

To delete the deployment and associated resources, run the following Helm command:
```
$ helm uninstall <release-name>
```
Replace `<release-name>` with the name of the release. This command will remove all the resources created by the Helm chart.
