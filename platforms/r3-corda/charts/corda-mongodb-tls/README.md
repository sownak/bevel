## Mongodb-tls Deployment Helm Chart
---
This [Helm chart](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/tree/develop/platforms/r3-corda/charts/corda-mongodb-tls) deploys MongoDB with tls enabled.

<a name = "prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites
---
Before deploying the chart please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Mongodb database up and running.
- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- A HashiCorp Vault instance is set up and configured to use Kubernetes service account token-based authentication.
- The Vault is unsealed and initialized.
- Helm is installed.

## Chart Structure
---
This chart has following structue:

```
  
  ├── mongodb-tls
  │   ├── Chart.yaml
  │   ├── templates
  │   │   ├── deployment.yaml
  │   │   ├── pvc.yaml
  │   │   └── service.yaml
  │   └── values.yaml
```

Type of files used:

- `templates`       : This directory contains the Kubernetes manifest templates that define the resources to be deployed.
- `deployment.yaml` : This deployment file can deploy a MongoDB database in a Kubernetes cluster, manages a MongoDB replica set and it configures environment variables for the MongoDB root username and password. And also its includes ports, volume mounts and initialization tasks using init containers.  
- `pvc.yaml`        : A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user.
- `service.yaml`    : This file defines a Kubernetes Service with multiple ports for protocols and targets, and supports Ambassador proxy annotations for specific configurations when using the "ambassador" proxy provider.
- `chart.yaml`      : Provides metadata about the chart, such as its name, version, and description.
- `values.yaml`     : Contains the default configuration values for the chart. It includes configuration for the image, storage and service.

## Configuration
---
The [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/r3-corda/charts/corda-mongodb-tls/values.yaml) file contains configurable values for the Helm chart. We can modify these values according to the deployment requirements. Here are some important configuration options:

## Deployment
---

To deploy the Mongodb-tls Helm chart, follow these steps:

1. Modify the [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/r3-corda/charts/corda-mongodb-tls/values.yaml) file to set the desired configuration values.
2. Run the following Helm command to install, upgrade, verify, delete the chart:

To install the chart:
```bash
helm repo add bevel https://hyperledger.github.io/bevel/
helm install <release-name> ./corda-mongodb-tls
```

To upgrade the chart:
```bash
helm upgrade <release-name> ./corda-mongodb-tls
```

To verify the deployment:
```bash
kubectl get jobs -n <namespace>
```
Note : Replace `<namespace>` with the actual namespace where the Job was created. This command will display information about the Job, including the number of completions and the current status of the Job's pods.


To delete the chart: 
```bash
helm uninstall <release-name>
```
Note : Replace `<release-name>` with the desired name for the release.
