This chart has following structue:

```
  
  ├── corda-ent-h2
  │   ├── Chart.yaml
  │   ├── templates
  │   │   ├── deployment.yaml
  │   │   ├── pvc.yaml
  │   │   └── service.yaml
  │   └── values.yaml
```

- `templates`       : This directory contains the Kubernetes manifest templates that define the resources to be deployed.
- `deployment.yaml` : This file is a configuration file for deployement in Kubernetes.It creates a deployment file with a specified number of replicas and defines various settings for the deployment.Including volume mounts, environment variables, and ports for the container.
- `pvc.yaml`        : A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user.
- `service.yaml`    : This file defines a Kubernetes Service with multiple ports for protocols and targets, and supports Ambassador proxy annotations for specific configurations when using the "ambassador" proxy provider.
- `chart.yaml`      : Provides metadata about the chart, such as its name, version, and description.
- `values.yaml`     : Contains the default configuration values for the chart. It includes configuration for the image, resources, storage, service, etc.

## Deployment
---

To deploy the h2 Helm chart, follow these steps:

1. Modify the [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/main/platforms/r3-corda-ent/charts/corda-ent-h2/values.yaml) file to set the desired configuration values.
2. Run the following Helm command to install, upgrade, verify, delete the chart:

To install the chart:
```bash
helm repo add bevel https://hyperledger.github.io/bevel/
helm install <release-name> ./corda-ent-h2
```

To upgrade the chart:
```bash
helm upgrade <release-name> ./corda-ent-h2
```

To verify the deployment:
```bash
kubectl get jobs -n <namespace>
```
Note : Replace `<namespace>` with the actual namespace where the Job was created. This command will display information about the Job, including the number of completions and the current status of the Job's pods.

To delete the chart: 
```bash
helm uninstall <release-name>
```
Note : Replace `<release-name>` with the desired name for the release.
